    To migrate a subscription from postpaid to prepaid you need to specify a product, which corresponds with

    A migration from prepaid to postpaid just requires you to specify the product id of the chosen postpaid subscription.

        There is one special case, the "wildcard" `not_final_or_with_mnp`
        which will return all orders that could need attention.
        In that case all other statuses in list will be ignored. As extra all orders with MNP will also be added.
